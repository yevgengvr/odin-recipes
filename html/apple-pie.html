      <h2 class="recipe-desc-title">Description</h2>
      <p class="recipe-desc">This amazing apple pie recipe belonged to my grandmother. I have never seen another one quite
        like it! It will always be my favorite and has won several first place prizes in local competitions. It makes the
        perfect dessert for family dinners or during the holidays.</p>
      <h2 class="recipe-ingredients-title">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="recipe-ingredients-list">
        <li class="recipe-ingredient-item">8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>
        <li class="recipe-ingredient-item">½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li class="recipe-ingredient-item">3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li class="recipe-ingredient-item">½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li class="recipe-ingredient-item">½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li class="recipe-ingredient-item">¼ cup water</li>
        <li class="recipe-ingredient-item">1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="recipe-steps-title">Steps</h2>
      <ol class="recipe-steps-list">
        <li class="recipe-step-item">Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Peel and
          core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>
        <li class="recipe-step-item">Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook
          until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and
          simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li class="recipe-step-item">Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out
          remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.</li>
        <li class="recipe-step-item">Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry
          strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the
          edges.</li>
        <li class="recipe-step-item">Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're
          almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then
          unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.</li>
        <li class="recipe-step-item">Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips
          perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position. Repeat Steps 6
          and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch
          to secure.</li>
        <li class="recipe-step-item">Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps
          over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.</li>
        <li class="recipe-step-item">Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F
          (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li class="recipe-step-item">Serve and enjoy!</li>
